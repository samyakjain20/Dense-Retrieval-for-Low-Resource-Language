# Dense-Retrieval-for-Low-Resource-Language
Built a specialized query answering retrieval model designed for low-resource languages. Utilized data augmentation and a zero-shot approach to automatically generate questions from native language passages. Integrated these generated question-passage pairs into a dense passage retrieval model for enhanced information retrieval capabilities.
